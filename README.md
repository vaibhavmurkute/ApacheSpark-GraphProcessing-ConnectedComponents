# Graph analysis program: to find connected-components in a graph using Apache Spark (scala)
===============================================================================
### An undirected graph is represented in the input text file using one line per graph vertex. 
### For example, the line

1,2,3,4,5,6,7
 represents the vertex with ID 1, which is connected to the vertices with IDs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
######

### is represented in the input file as follows:
- 3,2,1
- 2,4,3
- 1,3,4,6
- 5,6
- 6,5,7,1
- 0,8,9
- 4,2,1
- 8,0
- 9,0
- 7,6

### The purpose of this project is to write a graph-analysis program with Apache Spark (scala), that finds the connected components of any undirected graph and prints the size of these connected components. 
### A connected component of a graph is a subgraph of the graph in which there is a path from any two vertices in the subgraph. For the above graph, there are two connected components: one 0,8,9 and another 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Program should print the sizes of these connected components: 3 and 7.
